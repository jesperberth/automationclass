## Task 4 Connect Windows Host

Windows Servers can be connected in different ways, we will use ansible_messageencryption, but Certificate encryption is available, but requires more work

On

![ansible](/images/ansible.png)

We need to install pywinrm before being able to connect to windows servers from ansible

__Type:__

```bash
pip install pywinrm
```

![Alt text](images/019_install_pywinrm.png?raw=true "enable winRm")

Lets add the windows server to our ansible hosts file

Yes the password is in clear text, you can encrypt the password with ansible-vault

> **Note**
> Change __ansible_user__ and __ansible_password__ to your username and password

Add after the first group, linuxservers

__Type:__

```bash
vi hosts.yml

i (for input)

windowsservers:
  hosts:
    server3:
  vars:
    ansible_user: jesbe
    ansible_password: SomeThingSimple8
    ansible_port: 5985
    ansible_connection: winrm
    ansible_winrm_transport: ntlm
    ansible_winrm_message_encryption: always
```

__Type:__

```bash
Hit Esc-key

:wq (: for a command w for write and q for quit vi)
```

Lets test connection to the Windows server

__Type:__

```bash
ansible windowsservers -m win_ping
```
